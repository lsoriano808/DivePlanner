DivePlanner
===========
The program you are viewing is a dive planner following the PADI dive chart. This was my first project using the bootstrap framework. Calculations are done in Javascript, I am assembling a team to port this over to a wearable device so that divers may be able to modify their dives while out on dive. I feel that this would increase adoption in the even their are complications on dive based on external factors such as weather conditions change or another diver is in the area. I am open to adding more features on this project and if you would like to join me please let me know! 



**This program is just a prototype and is not intended for commercial use. So please do not use on real dives!**
